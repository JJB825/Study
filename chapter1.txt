Learning Github is very intresting and usesul for software engineers like us!!
git init: initialise git
git status: check how many files are yet to be pushed to staging area

staging area: required to push our file after every change that we made. tracks changes in our file. 
commit: when file is ready by all the changes, we commit it to git
