Branching:
-> Useful when something new other than the current pattern of work needs to be done, which is a type of trial and error
-> Used when new features need to worked upon and added to original ones
-> Two or more simultaneous work need to be done 
-> Useful when more than two people are working on a project and are working on different aspects of project 
-> In future, if the branched work is ready to be inculcated in main work, that branch can be merged with the main branch

Syntax: 
Branching: git branch branch-name
Merging: git merge branch-name
for displaying all branches: git branch
for going to certain branch: git checkout branch-name
